# Intrinsic Camera Calibration

## Get Started
IntrinsicCameraCalibration.py will allow you to get rid of the lens distortion
from your camera, undistorting the images in the process. To get started, try:

`python IntrinsicCameraCalibration.py -d <absolute/path/to/checkerboard/pictures>
-s <absolute/path/to/where/undistorted/pictures/should/go> -iw <image_width> -ih <image_height> -cw <checkerboard_width-1> -ch <checkerboard_height-1> 

* Camera Intrinsic Calibration Tools (e.g. Getting Rid of Lens Distortion)
* Camera-Lidar Calibration Tools (making sure the camera and lidars know when they are looking at the same thing)
* Other things TBD
